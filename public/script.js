Since he is sr engineer and I know he good about E// system, but I am just associate engineer so I feel my voice is not weight to him, also I do not want to report to my manager since I think we can talk and work out. I stand up and call him and ask the reason why nothing happen, first he said he busy and he does not have time but talk little bit more so I know the reason is he afraid to work on new stuff , I mean web technology , one problem about competencies and he not familiar that make him not interesting in. However, we have to delivery something in the deadline, so I tell him I can dedicate 1 hour per day to work with him, knowledge sharing and let him know the big picture of the tool. After that we work every day together, first he generate the report I help to populate into the web, also I share monitor to him follow up , and just need 1 week later he can do it from end to end. And we complete the dashboard on time. My manager is very sastify with that and we together have a presentation with directory about that tool and got many complismnet.

Other example is the dashboard I just build to my team to create landing page in splunk dashboard to keep monitoring all the secufrity log from OSS system to splunk platform. The onbstale is whenever we want to check the status of data transferring we have to login to splunk and manually use search query, that it take time and effort addition the management do not have the landing page to get the centralize overview how the system works. I saw that paint point and and bring my idea to build dashboard to mh manager. He agree and I start learn and reaserach more about splunk, also I connect to my college in spunk team and ask some knowledge sharing session. Everyday, I spend extra an hour to leran about search query, stat tstat splunk command, solunk dashboard layout , REST API etc. Just few day ago I complete the dashboard and introduced with the teram already, next I will wirte the MOP and ask somebodh join with me to get familiar with that in case if future new system integrate to Splunk , so make sure everyone in the team be able to implement that. <br>The main thing is not only inovsative but also I did shareing the new technologhy , new knowledge to the team , so will help them improve their skill set, compentcy.

Then I did a quick check-in with my manager. He mentioned that we have an impairment and need support immediately. I moved to other bridge and try my best to work with the vendor to recovery service to avoid impact to user as much as possible. After few hours to collecting the log and reboot the VMs , the system is full recovery, finally we got job done and bring service back to user.I did several heath check to make sure service full recovery and report with my manager.  I call the user again and we continue to troubleshooting his issue. By the end of the day, I finally find the RCA of the issue and help user resole the issue.

Since to implement the tool you must have the software running in background and system must have internet open to download that software. However, our system running inside NMNET and cannot connect to outside to download the software. I took a lot of time, extra 2 hours evening time and weekend to find the solution in current situation. I go through many online resource, ask expert. I note and collect pie by pie , try to test different way and finally , I got what I pay. Finally I find docker container is the best method in this scenario. So I can design and done everything in my latop, encrypt those to image and ship to the server. This challenge tech me  how important of hard work and learn the new thing is , you will get what you pay  "

    ques: "How do you work under pressure ",
    ans: "I enjoy working under pressure because I believe it helps me grow., I believe that my productivity is more than 100% under difficult and pressure situation. The pressure like stress, deadline , tough proposal my trick is keep calm and go about handling the situation is the best possible manner. For instance, I did get the callout at 1 Am about problem site status script that use for report status of all NE of TMO network. The script broken and over 4000 sites lost connectivity. And its escalate to president level, it’s a terrible pressure on my back.  I joined bridge and troubleshooting with NOC team and vendor. The tricky here is script is built in house therefore vendor refuse to support since they do not touch inhouse tool. So only way is I have to base on my experience and knowledge to solve this. I tell myself need to be keep calm and troubleshoot step by step.I replicate run the script, no issue but nothing to show. And do more about testing case.  Finally, I find the RCA is , the script query from database the site info , however , the password is expired therefore the result of query is empty. After I updated the db password, the script back to work and report the status as normal.  Keep calm and don’t panic is a good trick to due with pressure situation. "

    ans: "TO be honest, I allway work with 100% effort in any task. But in this situation I fell like I work more than 100%. I remember last year we have the outage when vendor delete the whole dataset even backup and it happened in Friday afternoon around 5 PM. We have an urgent meeting and my manager ask the engineer support because this is very important , since the whole system down and let all users in 3 markets cannot use the system to do their work. So I decide to volunteer to help even. I join the bridge with vendor to help provide the site list, in hours script and in the same time I need reply a ton of email and skype chat to guide user login to the new system to continue their work. Very stress and busy. So few initial hours , its kind very busy but after that we got better scenario. I focus more to collaborate with vendor to complete migeration and its took around next 10 hours. So until 2 PM next day, after run the assurance check list to make sure all services OK , I call my manager and report all of that. Wow that was amazing experience , I did now why I do not fell sleepy and tired during that time. My work was recognized from many users and management level. But the important is I want to share with you I show flexibility, how hard work I done and important is I always put the user supporting in the most priority "

    ques: "How you deal with the people different working style? ",
    ans: "Last 6 moths, my team had project to upload all the password system to CyberArk. I was assigned with another sr engineer in our team. The problem is our password place in different srepadsheet and if do manually its take forever since around 50 systems and one system have over 30 different password. With my experience about python,the best way to complete that is use programming language to manipulate those spreadsheet and combine to other one. However , I got the problem since the Sr engineer , she just want do manually and do not care how much time it is. First I do not understand why, I ping her and ask the reason why she reject my suggestion. I show her how quick and benefit that python can help in this project. Finally I got answer is she not confident in progarming language that why afraid to apply it into work. One, I convince her , another one I work with her to build the script, sharing knowledge about python and work together. After 2 days script is done and we try 1 spreadsheet first, just 5 second all password matching in new template. And just next 2 days , the huge number of passwords are in 1 place. We complete the project. Listerning first and patient is help me in this situation , but over than that I feel happy since I did sharing the knowledge to my collect , help her add more skill set. You know what, right now she might be better than me in python , she love it , she love it so much"

    ques: "What strategies would you use to motivate your team? ",
    ans: "In my view, I think communication, listerning first and recognize achievement is the best way to motivate the team. For example, my team had project to roll out FM post check automation , group had 5 perople and each of us handle 4 OSS. while 4 os us were engross working own system so there is one guy work very slow and seem like nothing in a week. I saw that and reach out him by a call , and after talking with him I know he has a limit about web technology therefore he was uncomfortanble to implementing the roll out.I tell him I can help him understand more the high level of the infrastrure , technology use in this project and set up 1 hour for pair review and knowledge sharing. I go ober the MOP again and ensure there is not ambiguous step no more. After 3 days, he know about and strat working his sruff and feel very interesting. The project done after 3 weeks long with 20 OSS complete. Team will be happhy with all thing we just done and contribution to the team. Last but not least , I did not forget send start reconization to whole team, sometime just small action  but contain a big meaning to other one. "

    ans: "Until now , my greatest accomplishment at work is success develop the password change tool for netact system and used widely in tmobile. Until now I the tool got over 10K inteactive and service the pw change for all market, region , field technical. Also help NOC 1.5 team avoid over 3000 Trouble TT from users. In addition, this is a bigest challenge I meet in my development career since there were many inssuficent infrastructure, guidance, support. However, with my hardworking and willing to learn the new technology I did complete the tool and got many many reconization from department level. I am actually pround of my hardword. One more accomplistment I want to share with you is My master degree, wow , that’s amazing. This is also a big challenge as well.

    ques: "The idea for the team ",
    ans: "Actually, I am a creative person, I usually bring a good idea to the team base on my software skill. Recently, I develop the tool that call NBI postcheck automation tool. As you know my team alway spend a lot of time and send a tons of Email and waiting to other team confirm they successful get and pull data from our system. And also do the same several test cases after major upgrade. I see that paint point and bring my idea to the my manager to buld the tool to do all that thing automatically. I start and work with other team to figure out how they can check the data from their end and transfer that to command line. The same I do with all the testcase in our system. The outcome is awesome , the team now can decreae from 2 hours to 2 mins by 1 mouse click. The main thing here I can utilize my software skill to help the team and business goal.  "
